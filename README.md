# ToDo

This is a project designed to help with time management. As many apps are out there, I think part of me just wanted my own solution, and it serves as an exercise in software development. The project is in its early stages at the moment, so expect this page to be updated with more thorough documentation when the time comes. T overarching plan is to implement a few unique features, including
* A heirarchical category planner, into which items can be sorted
* A full history of changes
* Extensive data analytics capabilities related to:
  * Setting and meeting self-imposed deadlines
  * Time distribution by category
  * Trends in interests and consistency over long time horizons

All of this has the implicit aim of enabling quantitative improvement on personal meta-goals, like consistency and organization.
